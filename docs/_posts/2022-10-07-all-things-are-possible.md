The title of this issue may be cheeky.  It would also be valid syntax.

It would translate to:

* Find all variables, functions, aliases, and cmdlets 
* Iterate over each of them, interesting the PSTypeName 'possible'

The all syntax keyword should be flexible and open ended, using the natural format described in #242.
