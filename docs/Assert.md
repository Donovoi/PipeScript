Assert
------




### Synopsis
Assert keyword



---


### Description

Assert is a common keyword in many programming languages.

In PipeScript, Asset will take a condition and an optional action.

If the condition returns null, false, or empty, the assertion will be thrown.

The condition may be contained in either parenthesis or a [ScriptBlock].

If there is no action, the assertion will throw an exception containing the condition.

If the action is a string, the assertion will throw that error as a string.

If the action is a ScriptBlock, it will be run if the assertion is false.

Assertions will not be transpiled or included if -Verbose or -Debug has not been set.

Additionally, while running, Assertions will be ignored if -Verbose or -Debug has not been set.

### Examples
With no second argument, assert will throw an error with the condition of the assertion.

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    assert (1 -ne 1)
} -Debug
```
With a second argument of a string, assert will throw an error

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    assert ($false) "It's not true!"
} -Debug
```
Conditions can also be written as a ScriptBlock

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    assert {$false} "Process id '$pid' Asserted"
} -Verbose
```
If the assertion action was a ScriptBlock, no exception is automatically thrown

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    assert ($false) { Write-Information "I Assert There Is a Problem"}
} -Verbose
```
assert can be used with the object pipeline.  $_ will be the current object.

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    1..4 | assert {$_ % 2} "$_ is not odd!"
} -Debug
```
You can provide a ```[ScriptBlock]``` as the second argument to see each failure

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    1..4 | assert {$_ % 2} { Write-Error "$_ is not odd!" }
} -Debug
```
