Language.Batch

### Synopsis
Batch Language Definition.



---


### Description

Allows PipeScript to generate Windows Batch Scripts.
Because Batch Scripts only allow single-line comments, this is done using a pair of comment markers.
        
```batch    
:: {
Uncommented lines between these two points will be ignored
:: # Commented lines will become PipeScript / PowerShell.
:: param($message = 'hello world')
:: "echo $message"
:: }
```

### Examples
> EXAMPLE 1

```PowerShell
Invoke-PipeScript {
    $batchScript = '    
:: {
:: # Uncommented lines between these two points will be ignored
:: # Commented lines will become PipeScript / PowerShell.
:: param($message = "hello world")
:: "echo $message"
:: }
'
[OutputFile('.\HelloWorld.ps1.cmd')]$batchScript
}
Invoke-PipeScript .\HelloWorld.ps1.cmd
```
