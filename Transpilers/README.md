This directory and it's subdirectories contain the Transpilers that ship with PipeScript.

Transpilers should have the extension ```.psx.ps1```

Any other module can define it's own Transpilers.

All the module needs to do for the transpilers to be recognized by PipeScript is add PipeScript to the ```.PrivateData.PSData.Tags``` section of the module's manifest file.

This directory includes uncategorized or 'common' transpilers.
